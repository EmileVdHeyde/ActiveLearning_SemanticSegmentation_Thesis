# ActiveLearning_SemanticSegmentation_Thesis
Repository of Notebooks and Code for Masters Thesis 


I recomend using the following for set up of the semantic segmentation base 
https://github.com/meetps/pytorch-semseg

Then adding the  customised python files for this experiment , along with the config files which needs to be altered based on the data location and iterations needed for each experiment. 

The folders are notebooks to perform the active learning component of the experiment
